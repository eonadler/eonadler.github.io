## Outreach

I am involved in several outreach activies to help foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive academic culture:

* I run **[AstroReach](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/astroreach/)**, a hands-on astronomy education program for high-school students.

	* **[AstroReach SD](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/astroreach/astroreach-sd?authuser=0)** is currently running at [The Preuss School](https://preuss.ucsd.edu/). I taught the first course in Winter 2025, *Dark Matter & Python*, supported by the UCSD [School of Physical Sciences](https://physicalsciences.ucsd.edu/). 

    * **[AstroReach LA](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/astroreach/astroreach-la?authuser=0)** was held at [USC Hybrid High School](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) in Spring 2022. I taught the course *Dark Matter & Data Visualization*, which was supported by a **[Carnegie Outreach Grant](https://carnegiescience.edu/news/inaugural-carnegie-dei-mini-grants-awarded)** and run in partnership with [Create Now](https://createnow.org/whatwedo/ourmission/), an arts education organization that empowers underserved youth throughout Los Angeles. All course materials are [online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f9bxYBslAa2ewfoNRDVXP7rPLzTOJFpWmnJYcIwo1MU/edit?usp=sharing).

* I ran outreach programs at [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/) for local high schools from 2021--2024, including [USC Hybrid High School](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) and [John Muir High School](https://www.pusd.us/muir).

* I was a mentor for **[Stanford Future Advancers of Science and Technology](https://fast.stanford.edu/)** from 2017--2019. This program enables underserved high school students in San Jose, CA to pursue scientific research projects.

## Service

I give back to the scientific community through public lectures, workshops, peer review, and department service:

* I have given **outreach talks** for the [UC San Diego Astronomy & Astrophysics Department Launch](https://universitydevelopment.cmail19.com/t/d-e-sdriuht-dkijeuldt-h/), [Carnegie Observatories Lectures at the Huntington](https://livestream.com/carnegiescience/darkmatterphysics/videos/236313712), [Pasadena Senior Center](https://www.pasadenajournal.com/theme-of-january-26-cosmic-cocktail-hour.html), [San Mateo Astronomical Society](https://youtu.be/v06iLuedjYQ?t=0), [Astronomy on Tap](https://app.discotech.me/events/36762040-astronomy-on-tap-at-dna-lounge), and undergraduate programs including [CASSI](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/carnegie-astrophysics-summer-student-internship-program-cassi) and the [UCSB Physics REU](https://reu.physics.ucsb.edu/).
