## Outreach

I am involved in several outreach activies to help foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive academic culture:

* I was awarded an inaugural **[Carnegie DEI Grant](https://carnegiescience.edu/news/inaugural-carnegie-dei-mini-grants-awarded)** to teach *Dark Matter & Data Visualization* in partnership with [Create Now](https://createnow.org/whatwedo/ourmission/), an arts education organization that empowers underserved youth throughout Los Angeles. The first installation of this course was held at [USC Hybrid High](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) in Spring 2022; all course materials are [online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f9bxYBslAa2ewfoNRDVXP7rPLzTOJFpWmnJYcIwo1MU/edit?usp=sharing).

* I run outreach programs at [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/) for local high schools, including [USC Hybrid High](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) and [John Muir High School](https://www.pusd.us/muir). If you are interested in an outreach event for your school, please [email me](mailto:enadler@carnegiescience.edu)!

* I am the postdoc and staff representative on the **[USC Physics & Astronomy Climate Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bk8EV-XkrqwboUlVhjYrmi--NbCFyo3s86ffWheQjbo/edit)**. In the 2021--2022 academic year, I helped develop and analyze results from the department's first climate survey.

* I served as a research mentor for **[Stanford Future Advancers of Science and Technology](https://fast.stanford.edu/)** from 2017--2019. This program enables underserved high school students in San Jose, CA to participate in scientific research.

## Service

I give back to the scientific community through service including public lectures, workshops, and peer review:

* I have given several **public lectures**, including at the [Carnegie Observatories Lectures at the Huntington](https://livestream.com/carnegiescience/darkmatterphysics/videos/236313712), [Pasadena Senior Center](https://www.pasadenajournal.com/theme-of-january-26-cosmic-cocktail-hour.html), [San Mateo Astronomical Society](https://youtu.be/v06iLuedjYQ?t=0), [Astronomy on Tap](https://app.discotech.me/events/36762040-astronomy-on-tap-at-dna-lounge), and undergraduate programs including [CASSI](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/carnegie-astrophysics-summer-student-internship-program-cassi) and the [UCSB Physics REU](https://reu.physics.ucsb.edu/).

* I have led **data visualization workshops** at the Santa Fe Institute [Complex Systems Summer School](https://wiki.santafe.edu/index.php/Complex_Systems_Summer_School_2019_(CSSS)) and [KIPAC](https://kipac.github.io/BootCamp/).
