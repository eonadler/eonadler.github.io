## Outreach

I am involved in several outreach activies to help foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive physics culture:

* I was awarded an inaugural **[Carnegie DEI Grant](https://carnegiescience.edu/news/inaugural-carnegie-dei-mini-grants-awarded)** to teach *Dark Matter & Data Visualization* in partnership with [Create Now](https://createnow.org/whatwedo/ourmission/), an arts education organization that empowers underserved youth throughout Los Angeles. The 2022 installation of this course is in progress at [USC Hybrid High](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid); all course materials will be available online.

* I am the postdoc and staff representative on the **[USC Physics & Astronomy Climate Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bk8EV-XkrqwboUlVhjYrmi--NbCFyo3s86ffWheQjbo/edit)**. In the 2021--2022 academic year, I helped develop and analyze results from the department's first climate survey.

* I served as a physics mentor for **[Stanford Future Advancers of Science and Technology](https://fast.stanford.edu/)** from 2017--2019. This program enables underserved high school students in San Jose, CA to participate in cutting-edge research.

## Service

I give back to the scientific community through service including public lectures, workshops, and peer review:

* I have given several **public lectures**, including for the [Pasadena Senior Center](https://www.pasadenajournal.com/theme-of-january-26-cosmic-cocktail-hour.html), the [San Mateo Astronomical Society](http://nebula.wsimg.com/f29ef262928d3dba118025d689e51d82?AccessKeyId=DEEA8EDAD4DCF5083531&disposition=0&alloworigin=1), [Astronomy on Tap](https://app.discotech.me/events/36762040-astronomy-on-tap-at-dna-lounge), and undergraduate programs including the 2021 UCSB Physics REU cohort.

* I have led **data visualization workshops** at [KIPAC](https://kipac.github.io/BootCamp/) and the Santa Fe Institute [Complex Systems Summer School](https://wiki.santafe.edu/index.php/Complex_Systems_Summer_School_2019_(CSSS)). 

* I have **refereed journal articles** for the [The Astrophysical Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0004-637X), [Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society](https://academic.oup.com/mnras), [Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1475-7516), and [Astroparticle Physics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/astroparticle-physics).
