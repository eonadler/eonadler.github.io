## Outreach

I am involved in several outreach activies to help foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive academic culture:

* I run **[AstroReach](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/astroreach/)**, a hands-on astronomy education program for high-school students.

	* **[AstroReach SD](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/astroreach/astroreach-sd?authuser=0)** is currently running at [The Preuss School](https://preuss.ucsd.edu/). I taught the first course in Winter 2025, *Dark Matter & Python*, supported by the UCSD [School of Physical Sciences](https://physicalsciences.ucsd.edu/). 

    * **[AstroReach LA](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/astroreach/astroreach-la?authuser=0)** was held at [USC Hybrid High School](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) in Spring 2022. I taught the course *Dark Matter & Data Visualization*, which was supported by a **[Carnegie Outreach Grant](https://carnegiescience.edu/news/inaugural-carnegie-dei-mini-grants-awarded)** and run in partnership with [Create Now](https://createnow.org/whatwedo/ourmission/), an arts education organization that empowers underserved youth throughout Los Angeles. All course materials are [online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f9bxYBslAa2ewfoNRDVXP7rPLzTOJFpWmnJYcIwo1MU/edit?usp=sharing).

* I ran outreach programs at [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/) for local high schools from 2021--2024, including [USC Hybrid High School](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) and [John Muir High School](https://www.pusd.us/muir).

* I was a mentor for **[Stanford Future Advancers of Science and Technology](https://fast.stanford.edu/)** from 2017--2019. This program enables underserved high school students in San Jose, CA to pursue scientific research projects.

## Service

I give back to the scientific community through public lectures, workshops, peer review, and department service:

* I have given **public lectures** for the [Carnegie Observatories Lectures at the Huntington](https://livestream.com/carnegiescience/darkmatterphysics/videos/236313712), [Pasadena Senior Center](https://www.pasadenajournal.com/theme-of-january-26-cosmic-cocktail-hour.html), [San Mateo Astronomical Society](https://youtu.be/v06iLuedjYQ?t=0), [Astronomy on Tap](https://app.discotech.me/events/36762040-astronomy-on-tap-at-dna-lounge), and undergraduate programs including [CASSI](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/carnegie-astrophysics-summer-student-internship-program-cassi) and the [UCSB Physics REU](https://reu.physics.ucsb.edu/).

* I have **refereed journal articles** for [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), [Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/), [The Astrophysical Journal Letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205), [The Astrophysical Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0004-637X), [Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society](https://academic.oup.com/mnras), [Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1475-7516), [Physical Review D](https://journals.aps.org/prd/), [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.aanda.org/), [Astroparticle Physics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/astroparticle-physics), and [Language and Cognition](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-and-cognition), and [Lingua](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/lingua).

* I am currently the **postdoctoral scholar mentor** for the UCSD Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics.

* I was the postdoc and staff representative for the **[USC Physics & Astronomy Climate Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bk8EV-XkrqwboUlVhjYrmi--NbCFyo3s86ffWheQjbo/edit)** from 2021--2024. I developed and analyzed a department-wide climate survey in 2022.

* I have led **data visualization workshops** at the Santa Fe Institute [Complex Systems Summer School](https://wiki.santafe.edu/index.php/Complex_Systems_Summer_School_2019_(CSSS)) and [KIPAC](https://kipac.github.io/BootCamp/).
