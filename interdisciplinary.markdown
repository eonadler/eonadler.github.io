## Science

I collaborate on and lead interdisciplinary research at the intersection of cognition, linguistics, machine learning, data science, psychology, and philosophy. Recent publications and conference proceedings are listed below:

* M. Chu, B. S. Desikan, **E. O. Nadler**, R. L. Sardo, E. Darragh-Ford, and D. Guilbeault. *Signal in Noise: Exploring Meaning Encoded in Random Character Sequences with Character-Aware Language Models*. 2022, [2203.07911](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07911) ([Association for Computational Linguistics](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/) accepted).

* B. S. Desikan, T. Hull, **E. O. Nadler**, D. Guilbeault, A. A. Kar, M. Chu, R. L. Sardo *comp-syn: Perceptually Grounded Word Embeddings with Color*. 2020, [Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 1744](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.154/).

* D. Guilbeault, **E. O. Nadler**, M. Chu, R. L. Sardo, A. A. Kar, and B. S. Desikan. *Color associations in abstract semantic domains*. 2020, [Cognition 201, 104306](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027720301256?dgcid=author).
