Welcome! I am a joint postdoctoral research fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](https://carnegiescience.edu/obs) in the [Theoretical Astrophysics Center](https://ctac.carnegiescience.edu/) and the [University of Southern California Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics/) in [Cosmolab](https://cosmolab.usc.edu/).

In January 2025, I will begin as an assistant professor at the [UC San Diego Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://astro.ucsd.edu/).

My [research](./research.markdown) focuses on galaxy formation, dark matter, and near-field cosmology. I am interested the formation and evolution of the faintest galaxies, the microphysical nature of dark matter, and the growth of nonlinear cosmic structure. I tackle these problems using semi-analytic models of the galaxy--halo connection, cosmological simulations, dark matter theory, and observations of small-scale structure including dwarf galaxies and strong gravitational lenses.

Building an inclusive scientific community through [mentoring](./mentoring.markdown), [outreach and community service](./outreach.markdown), and [teaching](./mentoring.html#teaching) is important to me; my efforts in these contexts are described on the corresponding pages.

I am a member of the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) Milky Way working group, [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) Dark Matter Working Group, [Satellites Around Galactic Analogs Survey (SAGA)](https://sagasurvey.org/), and [DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (DELVE)](https://delve-survey.github.io/).

Please see my [CV](./CV.pdf), [publications](./publications.markdown), and [media](./media.markdown) for more information!

## Research Opportunities

I am actively seeking undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers to join my group at UC San Diego. If you're interested, please email me at [enadler@carnegiescience.edu](mailto:enadler@carnegiescience.edu). A postdoctoral scholar job ad will be posted on the [AAS job register](https://aas.org/jobregister). 

## About Me

In 2021, I received my Ph.D. in Physics from [Stanford University](https://physics.stanford.edu/), where I was an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in the [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://kipac.stanford.edu/), advised by [Risa Wechsler](https://www.risawechsler.com/).

In 2016, I received my B.S. in Physics from the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/) in the [College of Creative Studies](https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/), advised by [Peng Oh](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~peng/).

I am passionate about interdisciplinary science; for example, I have participated in programs at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), where I co-founded the research collective [comp-syn](https://comp-syn.com/#/). My interdisciplinary work is described [here](./interdisciplinary.markdown).
