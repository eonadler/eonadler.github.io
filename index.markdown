I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/) and the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics/). 

My [research](./research.markdown) aims to reveal the nature of the dark matter particle by combining cosmological simulations, theory, and observations of the smallest cosmic structures including ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.

Building an inclusive scientific community through mentorship and community service is important to me; these experiences are described [here](./mentoring.markdown).

I am an active member of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/), and [Satellites Around Galactic Analogs Survey](https://sagasurvey.org/).

Please see my [CV](./CV.pdf) and [publications](./publications.markdown) for more information!

## About Me

In 2021, I received my Ph.D. in Physics from [Stanford University](https://physics.stanford.edu/), where I was an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in the [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) advised by [Risa Wechsler](https://www.risawechsler.com/).

In 2016, I received my B.S. in Physics from the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/) in the [College of Creative Studies](https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/).

I am passionate about interdisciplinary science, having participated in the [Complex Systems Summer School](https://wiki.santafe.edu/index.php/Complex_Systems_Summer_School_2019_(CSSS)) hosted at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), where I co-founded the research collective [comp-syn](https://comp-syn.com/#/).

I grew up in Santa Rosa, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Some of my hobbies are described [here](./personal.markdown).
