I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Carnegie Observatories](https://ctac.carnegiescience.edu/) and the [University of Southern California](hhttps://cosmolab.usc.edu/). 

My [research](./research.markdown) aims to reveal the microphysical nature of dark matter and the mechanisms that seed primordial cosmic structure. This is achieved by combining cosmological simulations, particle theory, and observations of the smallest known structures in the universe including ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.

Building an inclusive scientific community through [mentoring](./mentoring.markdown), [outreach](./outreach.markdown), [community service](./outreach/#service.markdown), and [teaching](./mentoring/#teaching.markdown) is important to me; my efforts in these contexts are described on the corresponding pages.

I am an active member of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/), and [Satellites Around Galactic Analogs Survey](https://sagasurvey.org/).

Please see my [CV](./CV.pdf), [publications](./publications.markdown), and [media](./media.markdown) for more information!

## About Me

In 2021, I received my Ph.D. in Physics from [Stanford University](https://physics.stanford.edu/), where I was an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in the [Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://kipac.stanford.edu/) advised by [Risa Wechsler](https://www.risawechsler.com/).

In 2016, I received my B.S. in Physics from the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/) in the [College of Creative Studies](https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/).

I am passionate about [interdisciplinary science](./interdisciplinary.markdown), having participated in the [Complex Systems Summer School](https://wiki.santafe.edu/index.php/Complex_Systems_Summer_School_2019_(CSSS)) hosted at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/), where I co-founded the research collective [comp-syn](https://comp-syn.com/#/).
