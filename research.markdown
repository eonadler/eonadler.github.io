### Cosmological Simulations of Milky Way-like Systems

I am developing the first suite of cosmological simulations focused on systems with histories that resemble our own galaxy, the Milky Way. These simulations will include a variety of cosmological initial conditions and dark matter models to provide accurate predictions for the impact of early universe and dark sector physics on tracers of dark matter structure in the Milky Way, including ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and stellar streams.

### Semi-analytic Predictions for Near-field Cosmology

Extracting cosmological information from observations of the local universe requires theoretical predictions for dark matter structure that are both accurate and efficient. I am expanding the open-source structure formation model [GALACTICUS](https://github.com/galacticusorg/galacticus/wiki) to generate *constrained* realizations of the Milky Way. These predictions will be thousands of times less expensive than existing methods and calibrated to match the results of cosmological simulations.

The Milky Way (black circle) is assembled from smaller systems; our approach guarantees that key observational constraints on the Milky Way's evolution, including the recent infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (red circle), are satisfied.

### Dark Matter Microphysics from Dwarf Galaxies

Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way inhabit small dark matter halos that are extremely sensitive to dark matter properties. By combining dwarf galaxy observations from the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and [Pan-STARRS1](https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/research/Pan-STARRS.shtml) with cosmological simulations, galaxy formation models, and particle theory, I have helped place new limits on dark matter's [mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00022), [interactions with the Standard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10000), and [formation epoch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01137). 

These constraints have been combined with strong gravitational lensing data to set among the [most stringent limits on warm dark matter to date](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07810). I have also developed [new predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08754) for dark matter structure in the presence of dark matter self-interactions, including [in the presence of a Large Magellanic Cloud analog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12120).<br />

### The Connection between Faint Galaxies and Dark Matter Halos

Understanding the connection between the faintest galaxies and the dark matter halos they form and reside in is a crucial component of galaxy formation and cosmological theory. I have helped extend empirical models of the galaxy--halo connection into the regime of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. The resulting framework flexibly models [satellite disruption due to central galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04467) and the [detailed relationship between halo and galaxy properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05542).  

Applying this framework to Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1 data revealed the [impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud on the Milky Way satellite population](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03303) and the efficiency of galaxy formation in low-mass halos. The model's predictions are also [consistent with observations of Milky Way analogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12783) from the [SAGA Survey](https://sagasurvey.org/).<br />

### Miscellaneous

In addition to cosmological simulations and semi-analytic modeling, I have studied dark matter in the context of the [effective field theory of large-scale structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10308) and [idealized hydrodynamic simulations of halo formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01449).

I have applied machine learning techniques to the dark matter problem to efficiently model [hydrodynamic simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04467) and the [galaxy--halo connection](https://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_fall_2018/posters/12264334.pdf), and to [generate realizations of dark matter substructure](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/final-reports/5210762.pdf).

I have collaborated closely on projects including [dwarf galaxy detection using astrometric data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00099), [modeling star formation in dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11876), and structure formation limits on [dark matter--proton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02936) and [electron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12380) scattering.
